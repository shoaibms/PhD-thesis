## From Traits to Networks: Decoding Wheat's Drought Adaptation Through Multimodal Imaging, Omics, and AI

### Abstract

Enhancing food security in a changing climate is constrained by a critical gap between our capacity to generate biological data and our ability to extract mechanistic insight for complex traits like drought tolerance in wheat, a crop that sustains a third of humanity. This thesis introduces an integrated, interpretable AI framework to decode the multi-scale architecture of plant resilience by solving four interconnected analytical bottlenecks in plant systems biology: analytical complexity, phenotyping, mechanistic understanding, and systems integration.

To systematically address these bottlenecks, the AI framework was deployed on a multi-modal, time-series dataset from contrasting wheat genotypes under osmotic stress, progressively revealing the multi-scale architecture of resilience. The Algorithmic Root Trait (ART) method resolved the phenotyping bottleneck by discovering latent root architectural features invisible to human perception, increasing drought tolerance classification accuracy from 85.6% to 96.3%, with a 5.8× increase in information density. 

Network architecture analysis addressed the mechanistic understanding bottleneck, revealing that resilience emerges from distinct tissue-specific metabolic architectures: tolerant genotypes form ~40% denser leaf networks for rapid coordination and modular root networks for localised adaptation, both governed by strategic temporal coordination patterns. The MOFA+ Transformer approach overcame the systems integration bottleneck by quantifying that in tolerant genotypes, key network interactions are 355% stronger and established earlier, unveiling the temporal precision that underpins resilience.

Together, these results suggest heritable plant resilience is an emergent property of the precision, timing, and architecture of multi-scale coordination, rather than the inherent superiority of individual components. More broadly, the findings of this coordination-centric AI framework provide a new suite of mechanistically-grounded biomarkers—such as 'coordination strength' and algorithmic architectural traits—to accelerate precision breeding. This research delivers not only a unified model of drought adaptation in wheat but also a validated, open-source suite of analytical tools to accelerate the development of climate-resilient crops.
